"""
Vwire Python Client Library
============================

Official Python client for the Vwire IoT Platform - send and receive data 
from your IoT devices with an API similar to the Arduino Vwire library.

This library provides a consistent API across platforms (Arduino, Python, etc.)
for seamless IoT development.

Quick Start:
    from vwire import Vwire
    
    # Initialize with auth token (uses secure MQTT/TLS by default)
    device = Vwire("your_auth_token")
    device.connect()
    
    # Send data to virtual pins
    device.virtual_send(0, 25.5)
    device.virtual_send(1, 60)
    
    # Handle incoming commands (like Arduino VWIRE_RECEIVE)
    @device.on_virtual_receive(0)
    def v0_handler(value):
        print(f"V0 received: {value}")
    
    # Run with timer support
    device.run()

Features:
    - MQTT over TLS (secure by default)
    - Virtual pin operations (V0-V255)
    - Timer support for periodic tasks
    - Event handlers for incoming commands
    - Automatic reconnection
    - HTTP fallback option
    - Compatible with Raspberry Pi, Linux, Windows, macOS
